Since I first received my rabbits, I imagined they would live in wide open colonies where they could play, run, forage, and groom each other. However, as a student who lives on rental properties, I’ve had difficulty creating that with the common rabbit enclosure designs. I can’t build permanent structures like barns or sheds, and my enclosures have to be (relatively) easy to disassemble and fit in my car when I move. 

These were quite a few constraints for my colony tractor design:
* Large enough to comfortably house multiple does and a buck.
* Should be passively safe against predators (not require hot-wire or livestock guardian animals).
* Shape adapts so that base is always flush to uneven ground.
* Movable by one person without equipment.
* Should be able to move in every direction.
* Has a double roof. This protects rabbits from the heat that would otherwise radiate down from the roof when it is in direct sun.
* Enclosure should be partially openable for feeding, but also be able to open completely with full access to every corner while standing.
I also had some material constraints:
* The framing wood pieces can’t be longer than 8 feet, which is the longest length that would fit in my SUV with the seats down.
* The framing had to be made from readily available materials. I couldn’t use thin lumber framing like other tractors I see online because I did not have a table saw to rip boards.
