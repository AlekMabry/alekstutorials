Since I first received my rabbits, I imagined they would live in wide open colonies where they could play, run, forage, and groom each other. However, as a student who lives on rental properties, I’ve had difficulty creating that with the common rabbit enclosure designs. I can’t build permanent structures like barns or sheds, and my enclosures must be (relatively) easy to disassemble and fit in my car when I move. I chose to expand and upgrade the classic 7’x3’ rabbit tractor design to 7’x8’, however it needed some extra features to keep it mobile, easy to clean, and stay cool in direct sun.
